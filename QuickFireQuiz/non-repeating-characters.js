/**
 * Problem 2: Find First Non-Repeating Character
 *
 * @param {string} str - Input string
 * @return {string} - First non-repeating character or empty string if none exists
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the string twice
 * Space Complexity: O(k) - Where k is the size of the character set (max 26 for lowercase English)
